Group 2:
The customer would like an on-line system to enter customer details for health insurance purposes. 
The system would then calculate the risk and produce a cost of insurance for the clients. 
The system should be clean and simple. 
The system needs to take into account the usual personal details and detailed health information. 
Where the client regularly travels outside of Europe and the US it should be noted. 
The administrator should be able to access detailed information and edit as appropriate. 
Once the client enters details it should not be able to be changed by the client.
